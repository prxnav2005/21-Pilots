# Day 11

Design and verify a 4-bit parallel to serial converter with valid and empty indications

## Interface Definition
The module should have the following interface:

```
input     wire      clk,
input     wire      reset,

output    wire      empty_o,    -> Should be asserted when all of the bits are given out serially
input     wire[3:0] parallel_i, -> Parallel input vector
  
output    wire      serial_o,   -> Serial bit output
output    wire      valid_o     -> Serial bit is valid
```

## Working description

- When the circuit is reset, the shift register, count and output registers are cleared, and the `empty_o_reg` is set to `1` indicating no data is being transmitted. 

- When `count` is 0, new parallel data is loaded and serial transmission begins. During this transmission, LSB of `shift_reg` is set to `serial_o`. Output is valid hence its set to `1`, shifting takes place and count is decremented. When transmission is completed, output is made empty.
