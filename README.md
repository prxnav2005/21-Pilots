# 21 Days of RTL

Hello and welcome to my 21-day exploration of SystemVerilog! For the next 21 days, this course will enable us to explore various flavors of digital design, starting from basic components like multiplexers to building complex, real-life digital systems. It challenges us to think critically, enhances our problem-solving abilities, and fosters creativity in coming up with efficient design solutions. Each task is designed to deepen our understanding of hardware description languages and how they shape the creation of powerful digital systems.

All of this is done using the [Quicksilicon](#https://quicksilicon.in/) platform and all your tasks can be done [here](#https://quicksilicon.in/course/21daysofrtl).
